  *Make sure that every common HTTP feature is checked*

  To ensure that you have properly installed/ enabled IIS. Open up a browser and type in the search bar 127.0.0.1. If your screen looks similar to the one below, you have properly installed IIS.

From the installation files, download PHP 7.3.8((php-7.3.88-nts-Win32-VC15-x866.zip). Theres a chance you may recieve a warning on the file. If so, choose to "keep" the file and continue.

 After downloading PHP unzip the contents into the C:\PHP folder.

Once connected to the session, go back to the Database settings and in the user you will put "root" and the password is "Password1"

We will now create a new database within HeidiSQL. In Heidi right click on the left side where is says "Unnamed", select "create new", and then select "database". Name the new database "osTicket". Once we have the new database setup go back to the osTicket browser and under MySQL Database type in osTicket.
